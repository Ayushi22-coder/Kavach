## 🎯 Problem Statement

India registered **1.14 million cybercrime complaints in 2023** — up 60% from 2022, and the trend has only steepened. The Ministry of Home Affairs reported that "digital arrest" scams — where fraudsters impersonating CBI, ED, or Customs officers trap victims in multi-day psychological hostage situations over video call — defrauded citizens of over **₹1,776 crore** in just the first nine months of 2024.

These are not opportunistic crimes. They are industrialised operations run from fraud compounds, often across borders, using spoofed numbers, AI-generated voices, and fake government portals.

**The core gap:** Law enforcement has evidence *after* the crime. What's missing is real-time intelligence *before* mass victimisation occurs — and a reliable tool to detect threats at the point of contact, not the point of complaint.

---

## 💡 Our Solution

**KAVACH** (कवच, Sanskrit for "armour") is a real-time, AI-powered, multilingual fraud detection assistant accessible to every Indian citizen — no matter their device, language, or technical literacy.

A citizen describes a suspicious call, WhatsApp message, or situation. KAVACH's AI engine analyses it against known digital arrest scam patterns and returns a clear verdict — **🔴 HIGH / 🟡 MEDIUM / 🟢 LOW risk** — along with exact next steps, in under 3 seconds, in their own language.

This shifts the response model from **reactive case investigation** to **proactive threat neutralisation** — stopping the scam before the money moves.

---

## 🖥️ Live Demo

The prototype is a single self-contained file: **`KAVACH_App.html`**

No installation, no server, no API key required to run the demo — just open it in any browser.

It includes **4 interactive sections** in one app:

| Tab | What it demonstrates |
|---|---|
| 💬 **Live Shield** | The core working chatbot — real-time risk meter, scam flag detection, evidence log, quick-scenario buttons |
| 📱 **WhatsApp** | A WhatsApp-style interface showing the same AI engine on a second citizen-facing channel |
| 🏗️ **Architecture** | Full system architecture, tech stack, and performance metrics |
| 📊 **Pitch Deck** | A built-in 6-slide deck covering problem, solution, judging criteria, and roadmap |

---

## ✨ Features

- **Real-time risk verdict** — HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW with clear reasoning, in under 3 seconds
- **8-signal scam detection engine** — authority impersonation, digital arrest threats, payment demands, secrecy instructions, video call pressure, missing ID, urgency pressure, fake portals
- **Multilingual by design** — UI and architecture built for 12 Indian languages (Hindi, Bengali, Tamil, Telugu, Marathi, Gujarati, Kannada, Malayalam, Punjabi, Odia, Assamese, Urdu)
- **Multi-channel** — Web app, WhatsApp, and IVR (1930 helpline) by design, ensuring zero-smartphone-required access
- **Live evidence log** — session ID, timestamps, and alert counter, designed for court-admissible export
- **One-click escalation** — simulated MHA/NCRB portal escalation with hash-signed evidence packet
- **Quick scenario library** — 5 pre-built real-world scam scenarios for instant demonstration
- **Zero cost to citizen** — designed as free government-funded public infrastructure, similar to the 1930 helpline

## ⚙️ How It Works

```
1. Citizen describes situation  →  via Web / WhatsApp / Voice call
2. AI engine analyses           →  8 scam-signal classifier + risk scorer
3. Verdict delivered            →  HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW + action steps, <3 seconds
4. Evidence logged              →  Session ID, timestamp, hash-signed record
5. (If HIGH) Auto-escalated     →  Nearest cyber cell alerted within 60 seconds
```
